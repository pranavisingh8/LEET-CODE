## 1934. Confirmation Rate 
SELECT
  s.user_id,
  ROUND((SUM(IF(c.action = "confirmed", 1, 0)) / COUNT(*)), 2) AS confirmation_rate
FROM
  Signups s
LEFT JOIN
  Confirmations c ON s.user_id = c.user_id
GROUP BY
  s.user_id;


Approach: case hwen and if else are all the same but divison always needs to be done outside sum brackets
