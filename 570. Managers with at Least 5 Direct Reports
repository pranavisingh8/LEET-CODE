## 570. Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports

SELECT e1.Name
FROM Employee e1
JOIN (
	SELECT ManagerId 
	FROM Employee
	GROUP BY ManagerId
	HAVING COUNT(ManagerId) >= 5
) e2
ON e1.Id = e2.ManagerId;

Approach: self join e1 on a subquery e2, which is the representation of the constraint where count of managerId is at least 5
